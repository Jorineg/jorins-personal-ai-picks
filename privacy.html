        <p>b. Information from Vercel Web Analytics or Speed Insights (If Enabled):<br>
            Currently, we do not have Vercel Web Analytics or Vercel Speed Insights enabled. However, if we choose to
            enable these services in the future, they may collect additional information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vercel Web Analytics: This service is designed to be privacy-focused and does not use third-party
                cookies. It may collect data such as event timestamps, URLs visited, dynamic paths, filtered query
                parameters, geolocation, device OS, browser type, device type, and an anonymized visitor identifier
                based on a hash of the incoming request.</li>
            <li>Vercel Speed Insights: This service collects anonymous performance data such as route, URL, network
                speed, browser, device type, OS, country, and web vitals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If these services are enabled, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect the specific data collected.
        </p>

        <p>c. Information You Voluntarily Provide:<br>
            We do not actively solicit personal information from you through forms or registration on the Website. If
            you choose to contact us via the email address provided, we will collect your email address and any other
            information you voluntarily provide in your correspondence.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected primarily to operate, maintain, and secure our Website through our hosting
            provider, Vercel. Specifically, this information is used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing and maintaining the Website's availability and functionality.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the security of the Website and preventing abuse or malicious activity.</li>
            <li>Monitoring network traffic and server performance (by Vercel).</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations.</li>
            <li>If Vercel Web Analytics or Speed Insights are enabled in the future, the data collected by these
                services would be used to understand website traffic patterns, user engagement, and website performance
                to improve our Website and user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (for GDPR purposes)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, our legal basis for collecting and using
            the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific
            context in which we collect it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Legitimate Interests: We process most of the automatically collected information based on our legitimate
                interests in operating, maintaining, and securing our Website, and ensuring its proper functioning,
                provided that such interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights
                and freedoms.</li>
            <li>Consent: If we enable Vercel Web Analytics, Speed Insights, or other non-essential tracking technologies
                in the future, we will rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing the information collected
                by those services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>a. Cookies: Cookies are small text files stored on your device (computer or mobile device) by your web
            browser.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strictly Necessary Cookies: Our hosting platform, Vercel, may use cookies that are strictly necessary
                for the proper functioning of the Website (e.g., for security, session management if applicable). These
                cookies do not typically require your consent but are essential for the Website to work.</li>
            <li>Vercel Web Analytics/Speed Insights: As noted above, Vercel Web Analytics is designed not to use
                traditional cookies for tracking, and Speed Insights also focuses on anonymous data. If these are
                enabled, their specific data collection methods will be detailed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>b. Managing Cookies: Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can usually choose to set
            your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject
            cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Website. For more information on how to
            control cookies, check your browser or device's settings.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information we collect in the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>With Our Hosting Provider (Vercel): Information collected automatically is processed by Vercel, our
                hosting provider, and its authorized sub-processors, as necessary to provide, secure, and maintain the
                hosting services for our Website.</li>
            <li>By Law or to Protect Rights: If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond
                to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the
                rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any
                applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>
            <li>Third-Party AI Model Websites: This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party websites of AI
                models listed on our Website. When you click on a link to an external AI model's website, you are
                subject to that third party's privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
                third-party sites you visit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We rely on the security measures implemented by our hosting provider, Vercel, to protect your information.
            Vercel employs various technical and organizational measures designed to protect data from unauthorized
            access, use, alteration, or destruction. While these measures are in place, please be aware that no security
            measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information
            transmitted to or from the Website. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any Vercel
            account credentials you may have associated with managing this Website.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We, through our hosting provider Vercel, retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
            purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For example, data collected by Vercel Web Analytics (if enabled) may have specific, shorter retention
                periods (e.g., visitor session data discarded after 24 hours ).</li>
            <li>Server logs and backups maintained by Vercel may be retained for operational and security purposes
                according to Vercel's policies (e.g., backups persisted for 30 days ).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location and applicable data protection laws (such as GDPR for EEA/UK residents or CCPA for
            California residents), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These may include
            the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to the personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate personal information.</li>
            <li>Request erasure of your personal information.</li>
            <li>Object to or request restriction of processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>Request data portability (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent (if processing is based on consent).</li>
            <li>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at jorinsaipicks@gmail.com. We will respond to your
            request
            in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We may need to verify your identity before processing
            your request. Please note that for data processed by Vercel as our hosting provider, we may need to
            coordinate with Vercel to fulfill your request.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Website is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or 16 in some EEA jurisdictions), and we do not
            knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently
            collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete such
            information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us at

            Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over
